Reading Tiled JSON output in Java

This is a small library that lets you read [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) JSON output into a Java object tree. 
The object tree basically matches the Tiled map structure 1:1.

It is a standard Maven project, the src/test dir contains a single test that shows you how to read a map from a File.

I might get around to polishing it and adding some JavaDoc someday :)
